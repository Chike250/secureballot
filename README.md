## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.x or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v9.x or higher
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) v14.x or higher
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v5.x or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

For Docker deployment:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v20.x or higher
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) v2.x or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Onyex101/secureballot.git
cd secureballot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration (see [Configuration](#configuration) section).

## Database Setup

1. Create the PostgreSQL databases:

```bash
npm run db:create
```

This script will create both the main and test databases as configured in your `.env` file.

2. Run the database migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This will apply all necessary migrations including:
- Core table creation for voters, elections, candidates, and votes
- Encryption field additions for secure vote storage
- Index creation for optimal performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

3. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data for development:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

**Note**: The seeding process will automatically generate election keys and create encrypted sample votes to demonstrate the full encryption workflow.

### Working with Migrations

Database migrations help you manage changes to your database schema over time. Here's how to work with them:

#### Creating a New Migration

To create a new migration file:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-new-table --migrations-path src/db/migrations
```

This will create a new migration file in the `src/db/migrations` directory with a timestamp prefix.

#### Structure of a Migration File

Each migration file contains `up` and `down` methods:
- `up`: Specifies changes to apply to the database
- `down`: Specifies how to revert those changes

Example migration file:

```typescript
import { QueryInterface, DataTypes } from 'sequelize';

module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface: QueryInterface): Promise<void> => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('example_table', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.UUID,
        defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4,
        primaryKey: true,
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false,
      },
      createdAt: {
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
        allowNull: false,
        defaultValue: DataTypes.NOW,
      },
      updatedAt: {
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
        allowNull: false,
        defaultValue: DataTypes.NOW,
      },
    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface: QueryInterface): Promise<void> => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('example_table');
  },
};
```

#### Running Migrations

To run all pending migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

#### Reverting Migrations

To undo the most recent migration:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:undo
```

To undo all migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:undo:all
```

To undo migrations to a specific point:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all --to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-migration-name.js
```

#### Migration Status

To check the status of migrations:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status
```

This shows which migrations have been applied and which are pending.

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

Run the application in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

1. Build the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Docker Setup

SecureBallot can be run using Docker, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v20.x or higher)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v2.x or higher)

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Onyex101/secureballot.git
cd secureballot
```

2. Start the application and database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build the application container using the provided Dockerfile
- Start a PostgreSQL database container
- Set up the necessary network between containers
- Create persistent volumes for logs and database data

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

### Running Database Migrations

To run database migrations in the Docker environment:

```bash
# Using the standard migration command (may require SSL)
docker-compose exec app npm run db:migrate

# For environments without SSL support (recommended for Docker)
docker-compose exec app npm run db:migrate:nossl
```

The `db:migrate:nossl` script explicitly disables SSL when connecting to the database, which is ideal for Docker environments where SSL is typically not required for database connections.

### Seeding the Database

To seed the database with sample data:

```bash
# Using the standard seed command (may require SSL)
docker-compose exec app npm run db:seed

# For environments without SSL support (recommended for Docker)
docker-compose exec app npm run db:seed:nossl

# For a smaller dataset without SSL (faster, recommended for development)
docker-compose exec app npm run db:seed:small:nossl
```

If you encounter SSL connection errors when running seeds, use the commands with `:nossl` suffix which disable SSL for the database connection. The `db:seed:small:nossl` command is particularly useful for quick development setups as it creates a minimal dataset.

### Viewing Application Logs

To view the application logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
```

### Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the containers and remove all data (including the database volume):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Docker Configuration

The Docker setup consists of the following files:

- `Dockerfile`: Defines how the application image is built
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes
- `.dockerignore`: Specifies which files should be excluded from the Docker build

The default setup is configured for production use. To use in development mode, adjust the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger/OpenAPI and includes detailed encryption flow documentation.

1. Generate the latest documentation:

```bash
npm run swagger-autogen
```

2. Access the documentation at:
   - `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` (when the server is running)

## Testing

SecureBallot includes comprehensive test suites for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual functions and components in isolation, typically using mocks and stubs for dependencies. Our unit tests focus on business logic in service layers, including comprehensive encryption testing.

**Authentication Service Example:**
```javascript
// Testing the login function in the authService
it('should login a voter successfully without MFA', async () => {
  // Mock dependencies
  const findVoterStub = sandbox.stub(voterModel, 'findVoterByIdentifier').resolves(voter);
  const compareStub = sandbox.stub(bcrypt, 'compare').resolves(true);
  
  // Test the function
  const result = await authService.login(loginData);
  
  // Assertions
  expect(result).to.have.property('token');
  expect(result).to.have.property('mfaRequired', false);
});
```

**Encryption Service Example:**
```javascript
// Testing vote encryption and decryption
it('should encrypt and decrypt vote data correctly', () => {
  const voteData = { voterId: 'voter-123', candidateId: 'candidate-456' };
  const keys = generateElectionKeys();
  
  // Test encryption
  const encryptedVote = encryptVote(voteData, keys.publicKey);
  expect(encryptedVote).toHaveProperty('encryptedVoteData');
  expect(encryptedVote).toHaveProperty('voteHash');
  
  // Test decryption
  const decryptedVote = decryptVote(encryptedVote, keys.privateKey);
  expect(decryptedVote).toEqual(voteData);
});
```

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. Our integration tests focus on API routes and controllers, testing how they interact with services and return proper responses.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Testing the elections API route
it('should return a list of elections', async () => {
  // Make actual API request
  const response = await request(app)
    .get('/api/v1/elections')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
    .query({ status: 'active' });
  
  // Assertions
  expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
  expect(response.body).to.have.property('elections');
});
```

#### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests verify entire user flows from start to finish, simulating real user behavior. Our E2E tests cover full voter journeys from registration to voting and viewing results.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Testing the full voter flow
it('should register a new voter', async () => {
  // Make registration request with test data
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/v1/auth/register')
    .send(data);
  
  // Assertions
  expect(response.status).to.equal(201);
  expect(response.body).to.have.property('userId');
});

// More tests follow for login, voting, etc.
```

## Encryption Architecture & Implementation

SecureBallot implements a state-of-the-art hybrid encryption system that ensures both vote privacy and integrity throughout the entire voting process. This section provides a comprehensive overview of how encryption works from the moment a vote is cast through the API to its secure storage in the database.

### Encryption Flow Overview

The encryption process follows a secure multi-layered approach:

1. **Election Setup**: Generate unique RSA-2048 key pairs per election
2. **Vote Casting**: Hybrid encrypt individual votes using RSA + AES
3. **Data Storage**: Store encrypted votes with integrity verification
4. **Vote Counting**: Reconstruct private keys and batch decrypt for tallying

### Detailed Encryption Process

#### 1. Election Key Generation

When an election is created, the system generates a unique cryptographic key pair:

```typescript
// Generate election-specific RSA-2048 key pair
const keys = generateElectionKeys();
// Returns: { publicKey, privateKey, publicKeyFingerprint }
```

**Key Management:**
- **Public Key**: Stored in election record, used for encryption
- **Private Key**: Split using Shamir's Secret Sharing (5 shares, 3 threshold)
- **Key Shares**: Distributed to authorized election officials
- **Fingerprint**: 16-character hash for key verification

#### 2. API Endpoint to Database Flow

When a vote is submitted through any channel (Web, Mobile, USSD):

**Step 1: API Request Reception**
```http
POST /api/v1/elections/{electionId}/vote
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {voter_jwt_token}

{
  "candidateId": "candidate-uuid",
  "pollingUnitId": "unit-uuid"
}
```

**Step 2: Vote Data Preparation**
```typescript
const voteData = {
  voterId: authenticatedUser.id,
  electionId: request.params.electionId,
  candidateId: request.body.candidateId,
  pollingUnitId: request.body.pollingUnitId,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  voteSource: 'web' // or 'mobile', 'ussd'
};
```

**Step 3: Hybrid Encryption Process**

The system employs a sophisticated hybrid encryption approach:

1. **AES Key Generation**: Generate unique 256-bit AES key for this specific vote
2. **Vote Encryption**: Encrypt vote data using AES-256-CBC with random IV
3. **Key Encryption**: Encrypt the AES key using election's RSA-2048 public key
4. **Integrity Hash**: Generate SHA-256 hash of original vote data
5. **Fingerprint**: Create public key fingerprint for verification

```typescript
// 1. Serialize vote data to JSON
const voteJson = JSON.stringify(voteData);

// 3. Encrypt vote with AES-256-CBC
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(aesKey, 'hex'), iv);
let encryptedData = cipher.update(voteJson, 'utf8', 'base64');
encryptedData += cipher.final('base64');

// 4. Encrypt AES key with RSA-2048 public key

### Cryptographic Algorithms Used

#### RSA-2048 (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

**History & Background:**
- **Invented**: 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at MIT
- **First practical**: Public-key cryptosystem based on integer factorization
- **Mathematical basis**: Difficulty of factoring large composite numbers

**How RSA Works:**
1. Generate two large prime numbers (p, q)
2. Calculate n = p × q (modulus, 2048 bits in our case)
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
4. Choose public exponent e (commonly 65537)
5. Calculate private exponent d where ed ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
6. Public key: (n, e), Private key: (n, d)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Well-established**: 45+ years of cryptanalysis and real-world use
- ✅ **Asymmetric**: Enables secure key exchange without shared secrets
- ✅ **Digital signatures**: Supports non-repudiation and authentication
- ✅ **Industry standard**: Widely supported across platforms and libraries
- ✅ **Quantum resistance timeline**: Safe until large-scale quantum computers

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Performance**: Significantly slower than symmetric encryption (1000x+)
- ❌ **Key size**: Large keys required for security (2048-bit minimum)
- ❌ **Quantum vulnerability**: Shor's algorithm can break RSA efficiently
- ❌ **Implementation complexity**: Requires careful padding and random number generation

#### AES-256-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard)

**History & Background:**
- **Standardized**: 2001 by NIST after rigorous international competition
- **Original name**: Rijndael algorithm by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen
- **Adoption**: Replaced DES as the U.S. federal standard

**How AES Works:**
1. **Block cipher**: Operates on 128-bit blocks of data
2. **Key size**: 256-bit key provides 2^256 possible combinations
3. **Rounds**: 14 rounds of substitution, permutation, and mixing
4. **CBC mode**: Cipher Block Chaining for added security

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Performance**: Extremely fast symmetric encryption
- ✅ **Security**: No known practical attacks against properly implemented AES-256
- ✅ **Hardware support**: Built into most modern processors (AES-NI)
- ✅ **Quantum resistance**: Effectively reduces to AES-128 strength against quantum attacks
- ✅ **Standardization**: NIST approved, NSA Suite B cryptography

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Key distribution**: Requires secure channel for key exchange
- ❌ **Single key**: Same key encrypts and decrypts (symmetric)
- ❌ **Block size**: 128-bit blocks may have theoretical limitations for huge datasets
- ❌ **Implementation sensitivity**: Side-channel attacks possible with poor implementation

#### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)

**History & Background:**
- **Developed**: 2001 by NSA as part of SHA-2 family
- **Purpose**: Cryptographic hash function for data integrity verification
- **Bitcoin**: Famously used in Bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm

**How SHA-256 Works:**
1. **Input processing**: Pad message to multiple of 512 bits
2. **Compression**: 64 rounds of compression using 8 working variables
3. **Output**: 256-bit (32-byte) hash value

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Integrity verification**: Detects any modification to original data
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same hash
- ✅ **Avalanche effect**: Tiny input change drastically alters output
- ✅ **Collision resistance**: Computationally infeasible to find hash collisions
- ✅ **Widely trusted**: Extensively analyzed and used globally

**Cons:**
- ❌ **One-way function**: Cannot retrieve original data from hash
- ❌ **Fixed output**: Always 256 bits regardless of input size
- ❌ **Quantum vulnerability**: Grover's algorithm reduces effective strength

### Why Hybrid Encryption?

The system combines RSA and AES to leverage the strengths of both:

**The Problem with Pure RSA:**
- Encrypting large amounts of data with RSA is extremely slow
- RSA has practical limits on data size (max ~245 bytes for RSA-2048)
- Multiple large RSA operations would create performance bottlenecks

**The Problem with Pure AES:**
- Requires secure key distribution mechanism
- Same key used for all votes could compromise entire election if leaked
- No built-in digital signature capability

**Hybrid Solution Benefits:**
1. **Performance**: AES provides fast encryption of actual vote data
2. **Security**: RSA securely exchanges unique AES keys
3. **Scalability**: Each vote gets unique AES key, limiting damage from any single key compromise
4. **Future-proofing**: Can easily upgrade individual components (e.g., RSA → post-quantum algorithms)

### Vote Decryption & Counting Process

When election results need to be tallied:

1. **Key Reconstruction**: Election officials provide their private key shares
2. **Shamir's Secret Sharing**: Reconstruct complete private key (requires 3 of 5 shares)
3. **Batch Decryption**: Decrypt AES keys using reconstructed RSA private key
4. **Vote Decryption**: Decrypt individual votes using their unique AES keys
5. **Integrity Verification**: Verify SHA-256 hashes to ensure no tampering
6. **Counting**: Tally decrypted votes and generate results

```typescript
// Simplified decryption process
const privateKey = reconstructPrivateKey(electionId, keyShares);
const decryptedVotes = batchDecryptVotes(encryptedVotes, privateKey);
const results = tallyVotes(decryptedVotes);
```

### Frontend Application Changes

**No Breaking Changes Required**: The encryption implementation is entirely backend-focused and transparent to frontend applications. However, some optional enhancements can improve user experience:

#### Recommended Frontend Enhancements

**1. Vote Receipt Display**
```javascript
// After successful vote submission
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/elections/{electionId}/vote', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ candidateId, pollingUnitId }),
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

const { receiptCode, voteHash } = await response.json();

// Display receipt to voter
showReceipt({
  receiptCode,     // 16-character verification code
  timestamp,       // When vote was cast
  electionName,    // Election details for confirmation
});
```

**2. Vote Verification Feature**
```javascript
// Allow voters to verify their vote was recorded
const verifyVote = async (receiptCode) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/votes/verify/${receiptCode}`);
  const { isValid, timestamp, electionName } = await response.json();
  
  return { isValid, timestamp, electionName };
};
```

**3. Security Indicators**
```javascript
// Show encryption status to build voter confidence
const SecurityIndicator = () => (
  <div className="security-badge">
    <Icon name="lock" />
    <span>Vote protected by RSA-2048 + AES-256 encryption</span>
    <Tooltip>
      Your vote is encrypted using military-grade cryptography
      and cannot be read by anyone during transmission or storage.
    </Tooltip>
  </div>
);
```

**4. Mobile App Considerations**

For mobile applications, additional security features can be implemented:

```javascript
// Enhanced mobile security
const MobileVoteEncryption = {
  // Client-side vote preparation with additional encryption layer
  prepareVote: async (voteData) => {
    // Optional: Add client-side encryption before transmission
    const clientEncrypted = await encryptForTransmission(voteData);
    return clientEncrypted;
  },
  
  // Biometric verification before vote submission
  requireBiometric: async () => {
    const biometricResult = await TouchID.authenticate(
      'Authenticate to cast your vote'
    );
    return biometricResult.success;
  }
};
```

#### API Response Updates

The vote submission endpoint now returns additional security information:

```typescript
// Updated API response structure
interface VoteResponse {
  success: boolean;
  voteId: string;
  receiptCode: string;        // New: 16-char verification code
  voteHash: string;          // New: First 16 chars of SHA-256 hash
  timestamp: string;         // When vote was encrypted and stored
  encryption: {              // New: Encryption details for transparency
    algorithm: 'RSA-2048 + AES-256-CBC';
    keyFingerprint: string;  // Public key fingerprint used
    integrity: 'SHA-256';    // Hash algorithm for integrity
  };
}
```

### Cryptographic Signature Verification (Mobile Voting)

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of votes submitted via the mobile application, SecureBallot employs ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures.

The process works as follows:

1.  **Key Pair Generation:** During registration or a dedicated setup phase on the mobile app, an ECC key pair (using a standard curve like secp256k1) is generated for the voter. The public key is securely transmitted to the server and stored associated with the voter's record (in the `publicKey` field of the `voters` table).
2.  **Data Signing (Client-Side):** When the voter casts a vote using the mobile app, the app constructs a canonical representation of the critical vote data (e.g., a JSON string containing `electionId`, `candidateId`, and the `encryptedVote` payload).
3.  **Signature Creation:** The mobile app uses the voter's *private* key to sign the hash (e.g., SHA-256) of this canonical data string. This creates a digital signature.
4.  **Data Transmission:** The mobile app sends the original vote data (`electionId`, `candidateId`, `encryptedVote`) along with the generated `signature` to the appropriate API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/mobile/vote/:electionId`).
5.  **Verification (Server-Side):**
    *   The server receives the request.
    *   It retrieves the voter's *public* key from the database using the authenticated user's ID (`voterService.getVoterPublicKey`).
    *   It reconstructs the exact same canonical data string that the client signed.
    *   Using the Node.js `crypto` module, it verifies the received `signature` against the reconstructed data string and the voter's public key.
6.  **Processing:** If the signature is valid, the server proceeds with decrypting the `encryptedVote` payload and recording the vote. If the signature is invalid, the request is rejected with an error (e.g., 400 Bad Request with code `INVALID_SIGNATURE`), indicating potential tampering or an incorrect key.

This process ensures that only the legitimate holder of the private key (the voter's device) could have generated the signature for that specific vote data, and that the data wasn't altered in transit.

### Hybrid Encryption (Vote Secrecy)

To protect the secrecy of the vote itself during transmission from the mobile client to the server, SecureBallot uses a hybrid encryption scheme combining Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) with AES-256-GCM.

1.  **Server Key Pair:** The server maintains a static ECC key pair (e.g., secp256k1). The server's public key is securely distributed to the mobile clients.
2.  **Client-Side Encryption:**
    *   When a vote is cast, the client generates a random, single-use (ephemeral) symmetric AES-256 key and an Initialization Vector (IV).
    *   The actual vote payload (containing `candidateId`, `timestamp`, etc.) is encrypted using AES-256 in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). GCM provides both confidentiality and data authenticity.
    *   The ephemeral AES key itself is then encrypted using ECIES with the *server's* public ECC key. ECIES typically involves:
        *   Generating an ephemeral ECC key pair on the client.
        *   Performing Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement between the client's ephemeral private key and the server's static public key to derive a shared secret.
        *   Using a Key Derivation Function (KDF, like HKDF based on SHA-256) on the shared secret to generate the actual AES encryption key and potentially a MAC key.
        *   Using the derived AES key and IV with AES-GCM to encrypt the payload.
    *   Libraries like `eciesjs` handle the complexities of key agreement, derivation, and packaging.
3.  **Data Packaging:** The client packages the necessary components for the server to decrypt: its ephemeral public key, the IV, the AES-GCM encrypted ciphertext, and the GCM authentication tag. This package forms the `encryptedVote` data, which is typically Base64 encoded for transmission.
4.  **Server-Side Decryption (`electionService.decryptVoteData`):
    *   The server receives the Base64 encoded `encryptedVote`.
    *   It decodes the payload and extracts the components (ephemeral public key, IV, ciphertext, auth tag).
    *   Using its *private* ECC key and the client's ephemeral public key, it performs the same ECDH key agreement and KDF to derive the same AES-256 key the client used.
    *   It uses the derived AES key, the IV, and the authentication tag to decrypt the ciphertext using AES-256-GCM.
    *   The GCM mode automatically verifies the authenticity tag during decryption. If the ciphertext or tag was tampered with, decryption fails.
5.  **Processing:** If decryption and authentication succeed, the server obtains the plaintext vote payload and proceeds with recording the vote securely.

This hybrid approach ensures that only the server (with its private key) can decrypt the vote content, while leveraging the efficiency of symmetric AES encryption for the potentially larger vote payload. The ECIES scheme handles the secure exchange of the symmetric key.
