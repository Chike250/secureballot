## Security Features

### Hybrid Encryption System

The system uses a hybrid encryption approach:

1. **Election Key Generation**:
   - For each election, a unique RSA key pair is generated
   - The public key is published and accessible to all voters
   - The private key is split using Shamir's Secret Sharing
   - Multiple election officials hold key shares

2. **Vote Encryption Process**:
   - Voter selects their candidate
   - A temporary AES-256 symmetric key is generated for the session
   - The vote is encrypted using this symmetric key
   - The symmetric key itself is encrypted using the election's public RSA key
   - Both encrypted components are stored separately

3. **Vote Decryption Process**:
   - When counting begins, officials provide their key shares
   - The election's private key is reconstructed
   - This key decrypts the AES keys, which then decrypt the votes
   - Decryption happens in a secure environment

### Additional Security Measures

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Voters can verify their vote without revealing choices
- **Vote Verification**: Cryptographic receipts with unique identifiers
- **Anti-Tampering**: Blockchain-inspired immutable audit logs
- **Key Security**: Hardware security modules for key generation
- **Forward Secrecy**: Session keys are never reused and destroyed after encryption
- **Quantum Resistance**: Extended key lengths to provide margin against quantum attacks
